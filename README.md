# Multiobjective_Optimization

This repository contains the scripts necessary for:
- Logistic regression
- Parameter acquisition for bisphosphine ligands
- Chemical space visualization for bisphosphine ligands

## Logistic Regression

The logistic regression script is designed to work with two excel spreadsheets: one with ligand descriptors and one reaction data. For examples, 'Bisphosphine_descriptors' and 'Bisphosphine_rxn_data'. 


Logistic_Regression_notebook.ipynb: code for 2-parameter model search is contained in Logistic_Regression.py. Code for validation statistics in contained in logreg_stats.py.
